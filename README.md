# kkro

> B Language Compiler

## Details

Built with LALR(1) grammar and parser (via lark).

I am still deciding the target platform. It will most likely be an older hardware emulation with word size, stack, and flash memory large enough for the B language.

## Dependencies

`kkro` uses `poetry` for dependency management:

* Run `poetry install` to resolve dependencies.
* Then, use `make start` to begin the program.
